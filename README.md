# Selenium Resume Projects



Before anything, don't forget to run
  
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt



Or

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    

and download the latest Webdriver for Chrome and/or Firefox.

Now change the CHROMEDRIVER and/or FIREFOXDRIVER variable in **conftest.py**

Enjoy :D.

Edit : If you want to test the dropdowns practice you would need to run
each tests individually. using '-k' parameter, like so

    py.test test_dropdows_practice -k multi

 or
 
    py.test test_dropdows_practice -k round
 
 or

    py.test test_dropdows_practice -k flight
    
These are compilations of me showcasing my skills in Selenium, and Pytest. I hope you find them satisfactory.
